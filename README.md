# 🚀 Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! As I dive into the world of ReactJS, Node.js, and React Native, I've decided to showcase my progress by building and sharing my portfolio using these exciting technologies. While it's currently a simple website, I have ambitious plans to continually enhance and expand it over time.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Utilized

Here are the key tools and technologies I employed to create the client-side of my portfolio:

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - A powerful web framework for building user interfaces.
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - The core programming language driving the interactivity.
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - A responsive front-end framework for creating sleek designs.
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - The language that adds style and aesthetics to the website.

## 📌 Version Information

The current version of the portfolio is 1.0, marking an important milestone in its development journey.
